# 5eSpells

This repo includes all of the data currently existing within the 5e Spells mod that contains several unimplemented spells in the Baldur's Gate 3 game. The reason for its creation was not only so players would have access to additional spells outside of those provided in the base game but also so other modders could use them in their mods without creating incompatibility issues.
